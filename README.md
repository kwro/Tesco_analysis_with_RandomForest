# Explaining customers' supermarket choice with Random Forest Classifier

Recently Tesco announced the closure of a few supermarkets in Poland (see details in this article: https://www.dw.com/en/british-retailer-tesco-scales-down-in-poland/a-48984312). This paper attempts to explain the change of customer's offline behaviour based on particular example of Tesco store in Warsaw, Stalowa street. In particular, I will check how the supermarkets portfolio changed after Tesco closure for each customer. Actually there are a few possible outcomes: some users might continue doing the shopping in the supermarket chains they are used to, others might look for a replacement. In the analysis I will try to reveal behavioural patterns responsible for choosing store brands. I will use random forest classifier to predict the replacement brand for each customer, then the used features will be analysed.
